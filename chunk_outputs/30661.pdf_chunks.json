SUMMARY \nWith the land ban on K-listed waste now in full force, and new regulations on the \nhorizon that would encompass virtually all other refinery waste, many refiners feel it is time \nto look seriously at commercially available alternatives to incineration. RCC is ready today \nwith the B.E.S.T.* 115R Solvent Extraction Svstem, a process that addresses not only the \nimmediate concern over K-listed waste, but the long term waste treatment requirements \nassociated with newly regulated primary waste, California waste, and RCRA closure waste. \nRCC can construct and start up the B.E.S.T. 115R System on site within 12-15 months. \nup to 40 tons per day of filter cake, and up to 25 tons per day of contaminated soil, all in the",

RCC believes that this versatility to alternate among \nvarious feeds is the key to solving refinery waste concerns over the long term.

It uses a unique \npolar solvent that eliminates the cost and uncertainty associated with pre-treatment for the \ncontrol of emulsions.
