Efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor\nmanufacturing techniques and effectively deploying those techniques across multiple facilities. The primary determinants of manufacturing\ncost are process line-width, 3D non-volatile layers, NAND cell levels, process complexity (including the number of mask layers and\nfabrication steps), and manufacturing yield. Other factors include the cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment, equipment\nutilization, cost of raw materials, labor productivity and cost, package type, cleanliness of our manufacturing environment, and utilization of\nsubcontractors to perform certain manufacturing processes. As we continue to increase our production of high value products and solutions,",
